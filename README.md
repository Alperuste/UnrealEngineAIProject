We follow and implement all the AI features shown in the videos.

First Stage; AI Characters running in the circle.

Second Stage; AI Characters collecting the closest gold coins on their sights to get the best point.

Third Stage; AI Characters try to sneak attack to eachother from touching back of others, once they hit one enemy, they are looking for other enemies.

Fourth Stage; They are running the safe place with their team mates.

And game ends.
